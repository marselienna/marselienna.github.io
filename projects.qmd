Final Project: Recipe Data with APRIORI
Part One: Creating and analyzing APRIORI rules
Part Two: Exploring Interesting (to me) APRIORI rules
Part Three: Creating a DataFrame to use in my program
Part Four: Creating a program in Python which allows users to select an ingredient from a dropdown menu and be presented with some APRIORI rules involving that ingredient.
